This a a utility app to easily plan personal finances.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

All data (app preferences (like theme, etc.) and alarms) created by the you (the user) is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

Explanation of permissions requested in the app

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email , and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,
